# Bitsek - a simple cryptocurrency implementation in Haskell

# About

# This document should include:
- The project title, the names of all group members, and a statement of the fact that this is the project for this course this year.
- A table of contents, an introduction, and summary of what the program does.
- Use cases: a guide for how to actually use your program, including key examples.
- Program documentation: a description of how your program really works, including at least:
- Description of data structures. For abstract data types, you should also describe the interface.
- Description of the algorithms your program uses.
- Description of the various functions of the program. Describe algorithms and provide functional specifications for the main elements. Describe the control flow (i.e., how functions call each other).
- Description of known shortcomings of the program. There may be things that work but not as well as you would like, or things that despite valiant attempts you have not succeeded in implementing properly.
