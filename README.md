# Bitsek - a simple cryptocurrency implementation in Haskell

# About
This is a Haskell project in the course "Program Design and Data Structures" during spring term 2018 at Uppsala University.

# Authors 
Benjamin Angeria, Holger Swartling and Fabian Haglund.

# Setup
Clone this repo to your desktop.

Run cabal install "package name":

- bytestring-conversion
- cryptonite

Run main.hs

# Table of Contents

# Introduction

# Inner workings
The program runs client-side commands in main.hs but uses the computationally pure Bitsek.hs for more demanding calculations.
# This document should include:
- A table of contents, an introduction, and summary of what the program does.
- Use cases: a guide for how to actually use your program, including key examples.
- Program documentation: a description of how your program really works, including at least:
- Description of data structures. For abstract data types, you should also describe the interface.
- Description of the algorithms your program uses.
- Description of the various functions of the program. Describe algorithms and provide functional specifications for the main elements. Describe the control flow (i.e., how functions call each other).
- Description of known shortcomings of the program. There may be things that work but not as well as you would like, or things that despite valiant attempts you have not succeeded in implementing properly.
